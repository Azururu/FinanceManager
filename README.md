## Backend
### Python
The backend is based on python using a flask server. The main functionality is sending SQL queries through endpoints to the database that I have built.
There are endpoints for logging in, storing data to database and returning data from database.
### JavaScript
JavaScript is used to gather user input values and sending them through flask server for python to handle.
It is also used to return data through flask and edit/create HTML content. 
## Frontend
### CSS
Styling for the webpage.
### HTML
Webpage structure.
